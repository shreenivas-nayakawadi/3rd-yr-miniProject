1. **Understand Needs**: Collect and define what the users need and want from the system.
2. **System Design**: Create a high-level plan or blueprint for how the system will work.
3. **Implementation**: Build the different parts of the system, like coding and assembling hardware.
4. **Testing**: Check every part to ensure it works properly as planned.
5. **Deployment**: Deliver the system for real use and make it operational.
6. **Maintenance**: Fix issues and make updates to improve or enhance the system over time.
